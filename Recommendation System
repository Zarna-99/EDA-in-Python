Its primary goal is to predict and suggest items that a user might be interested in, such as movies, products, articles, or music, among others. Recommendation engines are widely used in various domains, including e-commerce, entertainment, content platforms, and social media.\n","\n","There are several types of recommendation engines, but two popular approaches are collaborative filtering and content-based filtering:\n","\n","1. Collaborative Filtering: This approach utilizes the behavior and preferences of a group of users to generate recommendations. It assumes that users with similar tastes and preferences in the past are likely to have similar preferences in the future. Collaborative filtering can be further divided into two subtypes:\n","\n","> A. User-based: It recommends items to a user based on the interests and behaviors of users with similar preferences.\n","\n","> B. Item-based: It suggests similar items to a user based on the ratings and interactions of other users.\n","\n","\n","2. Content-Based Filtering: This approach recommends items based on their characteristics and features. It considers the attributes or content of the items that a user has previously liked or interacted with. By analyzing the item's features and comparing them to the user's profile, content-based filtering identifies items with similar attributes to recommend.\n","\n","There are also hybrid recommender systems that combine collaborative filtering and content-based filtering techniques to provide more accurate and diverse recommendations. Additionally, advanced recommendation techniques such as matrix factorization, deep learning, and reinforcement learning can be employed to enhance recommendation accuracy and handle challenges like the cold-start problem (where there is limited or no user data available).\n","\n","Recommendation engines have become vital in enhancing user experience, increasing customer engagement, and driving business revenue by delivering personalized and relevant suggestions. They play a crucial role in addressing information overload and helping users discover new and relevant items in a vast sea of options.\n","\n","In this notebook, we will explore three distinct types of recommendations: \n","\n","1. Popularity-based Recommendations \n","2. User-based collaborative filtering\n","3. Content-based filtering(simialr books based on book-title)\n","\n","Each approach offers unique perspectives and methodologies for generating personalized recommendations.\n","\n","Link to the app : [https://zarna-99-recommendation-system-recommendation-engine-xizrkh.streamlit.app]"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"45404dd3","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.024007,"end_time":"2023-05-31T10:37:19.253868","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-05-31T10:37:19.229861","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["### Table of Contents\n","\n","* [1.
